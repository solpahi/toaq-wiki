okay, here’s a probably bad proposal:
  put ma in LU and hi and co in LU+hoa and give them an indirect question constructing function (similar to experimental lo). then, make moq a question applicator. 
    this would keep ma questions the same, and, more importantly, ‘shift’ hi and co questions into the ma format:
      ma chuq jí máoja moq | hi chuq jí hóa (maoja3) moq | co chuq jí hóa maoja3 moq.
        it would also make indirect questions more streamlined:
          bu dua jí xó chuq hó (hóa): swap xó for ló, má, hí, có and you’ll get different meaningful indirect questions: ‘I don’t know that he eats/is eating’; ‘I don’t know if he eats/is eating’; ‘I don’t know what he eats’; ‘I don’t know how many things he eats.’
            I think that this approach is a little bit less naturalistic (few languages mark wh-questions at the beginning of a sentence), but more streamlined and uniform.
            as always, I’m interested in @Mỏılūq’s thoughts (other than M̉)


what is LU?
where is ma now, if not LU?
what is LU+hoa?
what are indirect question constructing functions?
how do indirect questions work?
how does (lo) work?
what would it mean for (moq) to be a question applicator?
is the Question Applicator different from the Illocution that (moq) is now?
what is the ma format? is it the structure of the prefix?

uakci said that this approach is more streamlined, if less naturalistic.
What do we care more about? naturalism or efficiency?

hıa and hue are to be considered deprecated. Instead, please make use of the many combinations of vowel + tone to establish new interjections. hıa and hue will become available as new root words or function words (actual new purpose to be determined).
Ah, I had been precisely thinking about hıa/hue like 45mn ago
(wondering whether they were going to remain in the language given they and ha are the only non-m interjections)

what's the history of hia and hue?
    why were they deprecated?
    what was their function?
what are the current rules for making interjections?
what is an interjection?
some examples of voweled interjections?

also ma is still not completely in harmony with the others as it takes no hoa

What is this disonance?
what is the work of hoa?
how do you know what word takes hoa?
what is the relationship between the interrogative prefixes and hoa?

although I agree that all this could as well be expressed with serials
I know that it stands out
but so do yes/no questions among wh-questions in natlangs
note that they are all lu
the only thing ma differs from the other three is (implication of) presence of hóa

what does it mean to be (lu)?

(technically the difference is that ma doesn't bind hoa)

What is the binding of hoa?
how are words bound?

I guess even though po is opaque, ja phrases should shine through it

What does it mean to be opaque?
what does this mean?

or never mind, I don’t like them to be LI
the Hoemāi kind of response would be ‘if you have a sentence so complex that you have to refer to an outer hóa, then you should re-do your sentence, not blame the grammar’
but I disagree
so let’s have hoihoa refer to the outermost hoa in an utterance
