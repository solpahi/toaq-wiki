## On the Bots

There is a #test-2 channel – we suggest you do any experiments with the
bots there so as to not crowd the other channels.

There are 4 bots:
- nuogai, operated by uakci. See its help with `%help`;
- SOA, operated by Hoemāi. See its help with `!help`;
- Septapus (general utility);
- Telegram (bridge).
