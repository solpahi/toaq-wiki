All right, these are the rules:

I.
There are:
   Predicates
   Arguments
   Terminators

II.
Predicates are flat.
Argumets are indented.
Nested predicates are indented.
Each predicate that takes arguments is uppercased.
Terminators are in the same level as the thing they terminate.
The prenex goes inside {curly brackets}
Inline English goes in parentheses.
The literal meaning of the sentence goes in "double quotes".

III.
like this:

("Want I eat you that"
I want you to eat that.
this uses serial predicates
, and lambda qualifier)
Shaon
   jip
   Chud
      sub
      nip
da

IV.
I know that its kind of redundant,
if there are tones already
its obvious what is an argument of what.
But as a begginer,
it helps a lot to SEE
what is an argument of what,
and where different parts of the sentence
   start and end.
So this would mostly be a tool for learning.

Here come the experimentals:

V.
the low tone (\, 6) is a simple way to
rewrite the sentence with the first part
as an argument to the word with the low tone.

that is:

Buan sub tik hi raip moq
=
Tin Buan sub na hi raip moq

so, the word with the low tone 
should be flat,
and its arguments
should be indented.

that is:

   buan sub
Tik
   hi rai
moq

VI.
I've heard that the creaky tone (~, 7) is the same
But I don't understand it well enough 
to try to do anything with it.

VII.
Also, ru feels as if it had two arguments,
the one before and the one that follows:
A ru B

So maybe write ru like this?
   A
ru
   B

I'm making this up as I go,
so be generous
