# This Wiki's formatting rules
1. Files cannot be extensionless, because the default extension is `.md`. For structured text, use Markdown files, not plain text.
2. British spelling is preferred.
3. All Toaq phrases should be put in bold markers (`**hion ka**`) – even names and single words. They can be written in Vietoaq or verbatim; the text in `**` will be properly formatted and converted.
4. Toaqise names. The same rendition of a name should be used across the entirety of a document. Tones are required: `mi Seamtal` **mi Seamtal** is correct; `mi Seaqtaq` isn't.
5. Remember to escape special characters: `^\_^` is a pretty little face ^\_^, but `^_^` will turn on italics.
6. Fancy quotes `‘’`, en- and em-dashes `–—`, and the ellipsis character `…` should always be preferred to straight ASCII quotes `'"`, hyphens `-` (where applicable), and three full stops `...` (unless in monospace). Same goes for arrows (`->` → `→`), emotes from Discord (`:t1:` → `◌̄`), and others. It's 2019, so Unicode fanciness is always preferred.
7. Edit messages for brevity and clarity and add the necessary corrections, formatting, and reorderings, but try not to distort the original message. If a correction or amendment is made to a previous line by the author of that line, apply it there. Expand text shortcuts and other ellipticals. Lines such as »thank you«, »I'll write later«, or others that have little to nothing to do with the conversation and aren't essential to it – remove them, perhaps replacing them with `[…]`. Add extra info and corrections in square brackets, like this:
  > This text is faithful to the source[, but this might not be.]
