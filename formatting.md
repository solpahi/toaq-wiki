1. Files cannot be extensionless, because the default extension is `.md`. For structured text, use Markdown files, not plain text.
2. British spelling is preferred.
3. All Toaq phrases should be put in bold markers (`**hion ka**`) – even names and single words. They can be written in Vietoaq or verbatim; the text in `**` will be properly formatted and converted.
  * Toaq contained within `**` *must* be fully toned; lightweight-styled Toaq, such as `Die jí rûqshua`, must be fixed to have all the tones (**Dien jip rudshuar**). Remember not to skip the first tone when single words are cited (**ruqshuar**, not `**ruqshua**`).
4. Toaqise names. The same rendition of a name should be used across the entirety of a document. Tones are required: `mi Seamtal` **mi Seamtal** is correct; `mi Seaqtaq` isn't.
5. Remember to escape special characters: `^\_^` is a pretty little face ^\_^, but `^_^` will turn on italics.
6. Fancy quotes `“”‘’`, en- and em-dashes – —, and the ellipsis character `…` should always be preferred to straight ASCII quotes `'"`, hyphens `-` (where applicable), and three full stops `...`. Same goes for arrows (`->` → `→`), emotes from Discord (`:t1:` → `◌̄`), subscripts (`₁₂₃`), and others. It's 2019, so Unicode fanciness is always preferred.
7. Edit raw quoted text by these guidelines:
  
  * Edit messages for brevity and clarity.
    - Add the necessary corrections, formatting, and reorderings, but try not to distort the original message and to retain the original formatting as much as possible.
    - If a correction or amendment is made to a previous line by the author of that line, apply it there, *retroactively*.
    - Expand text shortcuts and other ellipticals.
    - Lines such as »thank you«, »I'll write later«, or others that have little to nothing to do with the conversation and aren't essential to it – remove them, perhaps replacing them with `[…]`.
  * Add extra info and corrections in square brackets, like this:
    > This part of the sentence is faithful to the source[, but this part might not be.]
  * In places where the source of a quote might be unclear, be sure to add it.
