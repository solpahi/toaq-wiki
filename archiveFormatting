1) All Toaq phrases are in bold (**Bold**).
    a) even names.
    b) even single words.
And they can be written in:
    a) vietoaq
    b) tone markers
The **bold** function will replace all the vietoaq to tone marked words.
2) Please toaqize names.
    a) even the emoji ones :)
3) the not equal symbol is the â‰¶ 
4) tones are identified by their number (:t1:) or by their name (even tone)
5) we add extra info with [], like this: [not in original stuff]
6) We put quoted english inside double-quotes, like this: "banana"

1) remember to escape special characters:
    \^\_\^

# Not sure if this is a rule...
1) the conversations will be edited for brevity and clarity.
    for example, a sentence that is just a list of things will be
        changed to a literal list.
