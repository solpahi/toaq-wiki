## 1. Argument order
The dictionary and the official documentation present content word definitions like this:

> **maı**: ▯ loves ▯.

You would think that the usage of such a word would be:

> Subject **main** Object  
> **jip main sub**

Instead, it's like this:

> **main** Subject Object  
> **main jip sub**

Verb Subject Object is the standard; if you really need the subject to appear before the predicate, use **pa**: **jí pa mảı súq**.
